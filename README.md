# NationalHolidayApi

## Project Description

The NationalHolidayApi project is designed to help students understand and implement the Strategy Pattern in a real-world scenario. The project is a .NET Core Web API that provides information about Lithuanian national holidays. By working through this project, students will learn how to encapsulate algorithms within a class and make them interchangeable, promoting code flexibility and reuse.

## Understanding the Strategy Pattern

This section explains the Strategy Pattern, its implementation in the project, and its benefits, providing a clear understanding for students and contributors.

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it, promoting flexibility and code reuse.

### Key Concepts

- **Context**: The object that uses a Strategy.
- **Strategy**: The interface common to all algorithms.
- **ConcreteStrategy**: The implementation of the Strategy interface.

### Implementation in NationalHolidayApi

In this project, the Strategy Pattern is used to calculate national holidays. Different strategies for different holidays can be implemented and swapped without changing the core logic of the application.

### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between different algorithms.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies the addition of new algorithms.
- **Reusability**: Promotes the reuse of code across different contexts.
